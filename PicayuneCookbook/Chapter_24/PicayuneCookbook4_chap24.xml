The cultivation of <ingredient type="grain">rice</ingredient> began in <placeName>Louisiana</placeName> 
nearly a hundred years after it commenced in <placeName>Georgia </placeName>and <placeName>South Carolina</placeName>, 
but <placeName>Louisiana</placeName> now produces more of this beautiful grain than both these 
states combined. It is one of the greatest <placeName>Louisiana</placeName> staples, and 
<placeName>New Orleans</placeName> is the distributing point of the immense crop that yearly make
our immense <ingredient type="grain">rice</ingredient> fields of southwestern Louisisana the 
wonder and admiration of tourists.
         </p>
<p>
In no section of the world can <ingredient type="grain">rice</ingredient> be grown at so small a 
cost as in <placeName>Louisiana</placeName>. The cost of growing the grain in our matchless clime
is small, and it requires but little capital to begin. As remarked in the beginning of this book,
the consumption of <ingredient type="grain">rice</ingredient> has increased enormously of late, 
and it will continue to become more and more a popular article of food when the people of the 
great North and West learn how to cook it as well as the <name>Creoles of <placeName>Louisiana</placeName></name>.
</p>
<p>
The <sic>folloing</sic><corr>following</corr> recipes, carefully selected from among many that 
are used in this old <name>Creole</name> city of <placeName>New Orleans</placeName>, will give an
idea of how <ingredient xmlns="http://luc.edu/ctsdh/ns/1.0" type="grain">rice</ingredient> is 
prepared and made such a delightful article of food in our <name>Creole</name> households:

         <p>
The whiteness of the <ingredient xmlns="http://luc.edu/ctsdh/ns/1.0" type="grain">rice</ingredient> 
depends in a great degree, upon its being washed thoroughly. Pick the rice clean, and wash it 
well in cold <ingredient xmlns="http://luc.edu/ctsdh/ns/1.0" type="water">water</ingredient> 
before attempting to cook, rubbing the rice well with the hands, to get all the dust off. Pour 
off the first water, and add fresh; then pour off this, and add fresh again. The rice will then 
be ready to cook.
         </p>

         <div type="recipe" xml:id="pic24.2_how_to_boil_rice">
            <head type="main" rend = "align(center) slant(bold)">How to Boil Rice.</head>
         <p>
            When properly boiled, <ingredient xmlns="http://luc.edu/ctsdh/ns/1.0" type="grain">rice</ingredient> should be snowy white, perfectly
dry and smooth; and every grain separate and distinct. To attain this end, put a quart of 
<ingredient xmlns="http://luc.edu/ctsdh/ns/1.0" type="water">water</ingredient> on the fire, and let It boil well, with a teaspoonful
of <ingredient xmlns="http://luc.edu/ctsdh/ns/1.0" type="spices">salt</ingredient>. Wash a cup of rice well In cold water. When the 
water commences to boil well add the rice. Stir occasionally, and gently with a wooden spoon. The
boiling water will toss the grains of rice, and prevent them from clinging together. As soon as 
the grains commence to soften, do not, under any circumstances, stir or touch the rice again. Let
it continue to boil rapidly for about   
         <cb n="2"/>
twenty minutes, or until the grains begin to swell out, and it appears to thicken. This is easily
<sic>asceratined</sic><corr>ascertained</corr>by touching one of the grains with your finger. When
it has reached this stage, take the cover off and pour off the water, and set the pot in the oven,
so that the rice may swell up. Let it stand in the oven about ten minutes. Do not let it brown, 
but simply dry—that is, let the water which rises dry out of the rice. Take it off, and let it 
stand a few minutes. Then pour out into a dish. Every grain will be white and beautiful, and 
stand apart because the drying in the oven will have evaporated the moisture, leaving the rice 
soft, snowy white and perfectly dry. Boiled rice is delicious served with chicken, turkey, crab or shrimp or okra gumbo, as also with many vegetables, all daubes, and with gravies of all kinds. It is the standing dish on every Creole table.

   <head type="main" rend= "align(center) slant(bold)">Things to Remember in Boiling Rice.</head>
         <p>
Never set the <ingredient xmlns="http://luc.edu/ctsdh/ns/1.0" type="grain">>rice</ingredient> 
to cook in cold water, or you will have a thick, mushy dish that is most unpleasant to the sight,
and equally so to the taste. 
</p>
<p>
Always use boiling 
<ingredient xmlns="http://luc.edu/ctsdh/ns/1.0" type="water">water</ingredient>. 
Boil rapidly from the time that you cover the pot until you take it off, 
for this allows each grain to be tossed away from the other constantly, and also allows it to 
swell to three times its normal size. The constant motion of the water prevents the grains from 
sticking together.
</p>
<p>
Do not stir from the moment it begins to boil, for it will be noticed that when first the rice is
put into the water it will cease boiling till the rice is heated. Stir occasionally during this 
period, to keep it from sinking to the bottom and burning, but do not touch it with a spoon or 
fork or anything, once it has commenced boiling. Follow implicitly the directions about setting 
in the oven and allowing the rice to "sweat," as the <name>old Creoles</name> say. You will then
have a dish that is not only very beautiful and tempting to the sight, but most delectable to the
taste.

         Cut the pork very fine, lean and fat, into pieces of about half an inch square. Chop the 
         onions very fine, and mince the garlic and fine herbs. Grind the cloves. Put a tablespoonful
         of butter into the saucepan, and add the onions and pork, and let them brown slowly. Stir 
         frequently, and let them continue browning slightly. When slightly brown, add the ham, 
         chopped very fine, and the cloves of garlic. Then add the minced herbs, thyme, bay leaf and
         parsley and cloves. Let all this brown for five minutes longer, and add a dozen fine 
         Chaurice, cut apart, and let all cook five minutes longer. Then add the three quarts of 
         water or broth, always using in preference the broth. Let it all cook for ten minutes, 
         and when it comes to a boil add the rice, which has been carefully washed. Then add to 
         this a half teaspoonful of Chili pepper, and salt and Cayenne to taste. The 
         <name>Creoles</name>
         season highly with Cayenne. Let all boil for a half hour longer, or until the rice is 
         firm, and serve hot. Stir often, to mix all well. You will then have a real 
         <name>Creole Jambalaya</name>. Some use the brisket of 
            <ingredient xmlns="http://luc.edu/ctsdh/ns/1.0" type="meat">veal</ingredient>
            instead of the pork, but there is no comparison in the flavor, the pork being so 
            superior. But, again, this is a matter of taste.

         This is a most delightful Creole way of preparing chicken and rice. It is highly recommended. Prepare and cook the chicken as in Poulet au Riz, only do not cut up the chicken, but stew whole. When three-fourths done, add the rice, and in serving place the chicken in the center of the dish and heap the rice around. Young chickens are best for this dish. An old chicken may be cut up and cooked till tender, as in Poulet au Riz, (See recipe Poulet au Riz, under chapter on Meat Soups.)[l]

Then take a half cup of rice and wash it thoroughly. Add it to the chicken. Salt again to taste. Cover and let all simmer for about twenty minutes longer. Then make a Tomato Sauce (see recipe)[m]. Dish the chicken and rice together, setting the chicken in the center of the dish and the rice around for a border, serve hot. This dish can be nicely made from the remains of cold chicken or mutton.

         Boil the crawfish according to the recipe given. (See Boiled Crawfish.)[o] Clean and pick the crawfish the same as for a fricassée. Put two ounces of butter in the frying pan. Cut one onion in slices, add it to the butter, letting it brown nicely. Then add the well-seasoned crawfish, and fry them to a golden brown. Add one clove of garlic, finely minced, and minced thyme, parsley and bay leaf. Let this brown. After five minutes, add a quart of boiling water. Stir well. Season to taste with salt, pepper and a dash of Cayenne. Simmer gently until the crawfish are very tender. When done, add the juice of half a lemon, and mix one even tablespoonful of Curry Powder and one of flour with a little water. Bring it to a smooth paste by rubbing well, and add it to the crawfish. Stir constantly, and let it boil five minutes longer. Serve with a border of boiled rice heaped around it. Curry of Chicken is made in the same manner, by adding the Curry Powder.

         Under this cry was sold by the ancient Creole negro women in the French Quarter of New Orleans a delicious rice cake, which was eaten with the morning cup of Café au Lait. The Cala woman was a daily figure in the streets till within the

         last two or three years. She went her rounds In quaint bandana tignon, guinea blue dress, and white apron, and carried on her head a covered bowl, in which were the dainty and hot Galas. Her cry, "Belle Cala! Tout Chaud!" would penetrate the morning air, and the olden Creole cooks would rush to the doors to get the first fresh, hot Calas to carry to their masters and mistresses with the early morning cup of coffee. The Cala women have almost all passed away, for, as remarked at the beginning of this book, there is a "new colored woman" in New Orleans, as elsewhere in the south, and she disdains all the pretty olden industries and occupations which were a constant and genteel source of revenue to the old negro mothers and grandmothers. Only two or three of the ancient Cala women remain. The cries of "Belle Cala! Tout Chaud!" are now few and far between. Once In a while, like some ghostly voice of the.past, one starts up in bed of an early morning as the weak old voice faintly penetrates your chamber. In a second more it is lost in the distance, and you turn over with a sigh for the good old times and the quaint customs of old Creole days, which gave such a beautiful and unique tinge to the life of the ancient quarter.
         But the custom of making Calas still remains. In many an ancient home the good housewife tells her daughters just how "Tante Zizi" made the Calas in her day, and so are pre- served these ancient traditional recipes.[p]
         From one of the last of the olden Cala women, one who has walked the streets of the French quarter for fifty years and more, the Picayune has gotten the following established Creole recipe:
      </p>  
        <list>
         ½ Cup of Rice. 3 Cups of Water (boiling).
         3 Eggs. ½ Cup of Sugar.
         ½ Cake of Compressed Yeast.
         ½ Teaspoonful of grated Nutmeg.
         Powdered White Sugar. Boiling Lard.
        </list> 
         <p>
          
         Put three cups of water in a saucepan and let it boil hard. Wash half a cup of rice thoroughly, and drain and put in the boiling water. Let it boil till very soft and mushy. Take it out and set it to cool. When cold, mash well and mix with the yeast, which you will have dissolved In a half cup of hot water. Set the rice to rise overnight. In the morning beat three eggs thoroughly, and add to the rice, mixing and beating well. Add a half cup of sugar and three tablespoonfuls of flour, to make the rice adhere. Mix well and beat thoroughly, bringing it to a thick batter. Set to rise for fifteen minutes longer. Then add about a half tea-
         
            <cb n="2"/>
         <!--Column 2 Begins-->
         
         
         spoonful of grated nutmeg, and mix well. Have ready a frying pan, in which there is sufficient quantity of lard boiling for the rice cakes to swim in it. Test by dropping in a small piece of bread. If it becomes a golden brown, the lard is ready, but if it burns or browns instantly it is too hot. The golden brown color is the true test. Take a large deep spoon, and drop a spoonful at a time of the preparation into the boiling lard, remembering always that the cake must not touch the bottom of the pan. Let fry to a nice brown. The old Cala women used to take the Calas piping hot, wrap them in a clean towel, basket or bowl, and rush through the streets with the welcome cry, "Belle Cala Tout Chaud!" ringing on the morning air. But in families the cook simply takes the Calas out of the frying pan and drains off the lard by laying in a colander or On heated pieces of brown paper. They are then placed in a hot dish, feind sprinkled over with powdered white sugar, and eaten hot with Café au Lait.
         The above quantity will make six cakes. Increase in proportion.
         Calas may also be made of rice flour. In olden days the Cala women used to pound the rice themselves in a mortar till they reduced it to a fine powder or flour. Then it was mixed and set to rise overnight. If the rice flour is used, one tablespoonful of wheat flour is sufficient to bind.
         Often in large Creole families, where rice is left over from the day before, the quantity is increased by adding a cup of well-sifted self-raising flour. But these cakes, though very nice and palatable, are not the true "Calas," which are made entirely of rice, with only a little flour to bind, as directed above.

         The rice must be cold and well mashed. Melt the two tablespoonfuls of butter into the milk, which has been allowed to cool. Beat the yolks of the eggs and the whites seperately[q], making the latter come to a stiff froth. Mix the rice and milk. Beat thoroughly, and then add a half teaspoonful of salt and one of baking powder, and the flour. Put the yolks into the batter, first blending well, and lastly add the whites, and beat well again. The waffle iron should be very hot, and well greased in every part. Always have a little brush with which to grease the waffle

         irons. Pour the batter into a pitcher, so that you may more easily fill the irons. Open the irons, pour the batter from the pitcher and fill the iron quickly. Then close quickly and set on the fire. As soon as the edges are set, turn the iron and bake on the other side. Two minutes should be all the time required to bake a waffle nicely. The waffle must be baked evenly. Always select the simple waffle baker with four compartments in preference to the more elaborate designs. Better results will be achieved. When the waffles are baked, remove them carefully, place on a hot dish, piling them in double rows, and butter them generously. Rice waffles are generally served with ground cinnamon and sugar mixed and sprinkled over. But this is a matter of taste. They are very delicious when served with butter and Louisiana Syrup or Molasses.
