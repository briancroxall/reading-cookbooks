The cultivation of 
<ingredient xmlns="http://luc.edu/ctsdh/ns/1.0" class="grain">rice</ingredient> began in 
<placeName>Louisiana</placeName> 
nearly a hundred years after it commenced in 
<placeName>Georgia</placeName> and 
<placeName>South Carolina</placeName>, 
but 
<placeName>Louisiana</placeName> now produces more of this beautiful grain than both these 
states combined. It is one of the greatest 
<placeName>Louisiana</placeName> staples, and 
<placeName>New Orleans</placeName> is the distributing point of the immense crop that yearly 
make our immense 
<ingredient xmlns="http://luc.edu/ctsdh/ns/1.0" class="grain">rice</ingredient> fields of 
<placeName>southwestern Louisisana</placeName> the wonder and admiration of tourists.
         </p>
<p>
In no section of the world can 
<ingredient xmlns="http://luc.edu/ctsdh/ns/1.0" class="grain">rice</ingredient> be grown at so 
small a cost as in 
<placeName>Louisiana</placeName>. The cost of growing the grain in our matchless clime
is small, and it requires but little capital to begin. As remarked in the beginning of this book,
the consumption of 
<ingredient xmlns="http://luc.edu/ctsdh/ns/1.0" class="grain">rice</ingredient> has increased 
enormously of late, and it will continue to become more and more a popular article of food when 
the people of the great North and West learn how to cook it as well as the 
<name>Creoles of <placeName>Louisiana</placeName></name>.
</p>
<p>
The 
<choice><sic>folloing</sic><corr>following</corr></choice> recipes, carefully selected from 
among many that are used in this 
<name>old Creole city of <placeName>New Orleans</placeName></name>,
will give an idea of how 
<ingredient xmlns="http://luc.edu/ctsdh/ns/1.0" class="grain">rice</ingredient> is 
prepared and made such a delightful article of food in our <name>Creole</name> households:

The whiteness of the <ingredient xmlns="http://luc.edu/ctsdh/ns/1.0" type="grain">rice</ingredient> 
depends in a great degree, upon its being washed thoroughly. Pick the rice clean, and wash it 
well in cold <ingredient xmlns="http://luc.edu/ctsdh/ns/1.0" type="water">water</ingredient> 
before attempting to cook, rubbing the rice well with the hands, to get all the dust off. Pour 
off the first water, and add fresh; then pour off this, and add fresh again. The rice will then 
be ready to cook.

When properly boiled, 
<ingredient xmlns="http://luc.edu/ctsdh/ns/1.0" class="grain">rice</ingredient> should be snowy 
white, perfectly dry and smooth; and every grain separate and distinct. To attain this end, put 
a quart of 
<ingredient xmlns="http://luc.edu/ctsdh/ns/1.0" class="liquid">water</ingredient> on the fire, 
and let it boil well, with a teaspoonful of 
<ingredient xmlns="http://luc.edu/ctsdh/ns/1.0" class="salt">salt</ingredient>. Wash a cup 
of rice well In cold water. When the water commences to boil well add the rice. Stir 
occasionally, and gently with a wooden spoon. The boiling water will toss the grains of rice, 
and prevent them from clinging together. As soon as the grains commence to soften, do not, under 
any circumstances, stir or touch the rice again. Let it continue to boil rapidly for about   
         <cb n="2"/>
twenty minutes, or until the grains begin to swell out, and it appears to thicken. This is easily
<choice><sic>asceratined</sic><corr>ascertained</corr></choice>by touching one of the grains with 
your finger. Whenit has reached this stage, take the cover off and pour off the water, and set the 
pot in the oven,so that the rice may swell up. Let it stand in the oven about ten minutes. Do not let it brown, 
but simply dry—that is, let the water which rises dry out of the rice. Take it off, and let it 
stand a few minutes. Then pour out into a dish. Every grain will be white and beautiful, and 
stand apart because the drying in the oven will have evaporated the moisture, leaving the rice 
soft, snowy white and perfectly dry. Boiled rice is delicious served with

     <div type="instuctions">   
   <p>
Never set the <ingredient xmlns="http://luc.edu/ctsdh/ns/1.0" class="grain">rice</ingredient> 
to cook in cold water, or you will have a thick, mushy dish that is most unpleasant to the sight,
and equally so to the taste. 
</p>
<p>
Always use boiling 
<ingredient xmlns="http://luc.edu/ctsdh/ns/1.0" class="liquid">water</ingredient>. 
Boil rapidly from the time that you cover the pot until you take it off, 
for this allows each grain to be tossed away from the other constantly, and also allows it to 
swell to three times its normal size. The constant motion of the water prevents the grains from 
sticking together.
</p>
<p>
Do not stir from the moment it begins to boil, for it will be noticed that when first the rice is
put into the water it will cease boiling till the rice is heated. Stir occasionally during this 
period, to keep it from sinking to the bottom and burning, but do not touch it with a spoon or 
fork or anything, once it has commenced boiling. Follow implicitly the directions about setting 
in the oven and allowing the rice to "sweat," as the <name>old Creoles</name> say. You will then
have a dish that is not only very beautiful and tempting to the sight, but most delectable to the
taste.

         Cut the pork very fine, lean and fat, into pieces of about half an inch square. Chop the 
         onions very fine, and mince the garlic and fine herbs. Grind the cloves. Put a tablespoonful
         of butter into the saucepan, and add the onions and pork, and let them brown slowly. Stir 
         frequently, and let them continue browning slightly. When slightly brown, add the ham, 
         chopped very fine, and the cloves of garlic. Then add the minced herbs, thyme, bay leaf and
         parsley and cloves. Let all this brown for five minutes longer, and add a dozen fine 
         Chaurice, cut apart, and let all cook five minutes longer. Then add the three quarts of 
         water or broth, always using in preference the broth. Let it all cook for ten minutes, 
         and when it comes to a boil add the rice, which has been carefully washed. Then add to 
         this a half teaspoonful of Chili pepper, and salt and Cayenne to taste. The

         season highly with Cayenne. Let all boil for a half hour longer, or until the rice is

            instead of the pork, but there is no comparison in the flavor, the pork being so 
            superior. But, again, this is a matter of taste.

            Chop two onions very fine, and put them in a saucepan to brown with a tablespoonful of
            butter. After a few minutes add a tablespoonful of flour and stir well. Then add 
            chopped thyme, bay leaf and parsley, and two cloves of garlic, minced very fine. Let 
            all of this fry five minutes longer, and be careful not to let it burn or brown too 
            much. Add a half teaspoonful of Chili pepper, and three large tomatoes, chopped fine,
            and also add the juice. Let all brown or simmer for ten minutes longer. When cooked, 
            add three quarts of broth or water, or, if on Friday, and you do not eat meat, add

            Let the mixture boil again for five minutes, and add one cup and a half of rice, or 
            half a pound, which has been well washed. Mix all well, and let boil for a half or 
            three- quarters of an hour longer, stirring every once in a while, so as to mix all

Under this cry was sold by the <name>ancient Creole negro women</name> 
in the French Quarter of New Orleans a delicious rice cake, which was eaten with the morning cup 
of Café au Lait. The Cala woman was a daily figure in the streets till within the             
              <pb n="169"/>
    <cb n="1"/> 
last two or three years. She went her rounds In quaint bandana tignon, guinea blue dress, and 
white apron, and carried on her head a covered bowl, in which were the dainty and hot Galas. Her 
cry, "Belle Cala! Tout Chaud!" would penetrate the morning air, and the 
<name>olden Creole cooks</name> 
would rush to the doors to get the first fresh, hot Calas to carry to their masters and 
mistresses with the early morning cup of coffee. The Cala women have almost all passed away, for,
as remarked at the beginning of this book, there is a "new colored woman" in New Orleans, as 
elsewhere in the south, and she disdains all the pretty olden industries and occupations which 
were a constant and genteel source of revenue to the old negro mothers and grandmothers. Only two
or three of the ancient Cala women remain. The cries of "Belle Cala! Tout Chaud!" are now few and
far between. Once In a while, like some ghostly voice of the past, one starts up in bed of an 
early morning as the weak old voice faintly penetrates your chamber. In a second more it is lost 
in the distance, and you turn over with a sigh for the good old times and the quaint customs of 
<name>old Creole days</name>,
which gave such a beautiful and unique tinge to the life of the ancient quarter.
        </p>
    <p>  
But the custom of making Calas still remains. In many an ancient home the good housewife tells 
her daughters just how "Tante Zizi" made the Calas in her day, and so are pre- served these 
ancient traditional recipes.
From one of the last of the olden Cala women, one who has walked the streets of the French 
quarter for fifty years and more, the Picayune has gotten the following established <name>Creole</name> 
recipe:

Put three cups of water in a saucepan and let it boil hard. Wash half a cup of rice thoroughly, 
and drain and put in the boiling water. Let it boil till very soft and mushy. Take it out and set
it to cool. When cold, mash well and mix with the yeast, which you will have dissolved In a half 
cup of hot water. Set the rice to rise overnight. In the morning beat three eggs thoroughly, and 
add to the rice, mixing and beating well. Add a half cup of sugar and three tablespoonfuls of 
<ingredient xmlns="http://luc.edu/ctsdh/ns/1.0" class="grain">flour</ingredient>, 
to make the rice adhere. Mix well and beat thoroughly, bringing it to a thick batter. Set to rise
for fifteen minutes longer. Then add about a half tea-        
            <cb n="2"/>  
spoonful of grated nutmeg, and mix well. Have ready a frying pan, in which there is sufficient 
quantity of lard boiling for the rice cakes to swim in it. Test by dropping in a small piece of 
bread. If it becomes a golden brown, the lard is ready, but if it burns or browns instantly it is
too hot. The golden brown color is the true test. Take a large deep spoon, and drop a spoonful at
a time of the preparation into the boiling lard, remembering always that the cake must not touch 
the bottom of the pan. Let fry to a nice brown. The old Cala women used to take the Calas piping 
hot, wrap them in a clean towel, basket or bowl, and rush through the streets with the welcome 
cry, "Belle Cala Tout Chaud!" ringing on the morning air. But in families the cook simply takes 
the Calas out of the frying pan and drains off the lard by laying in a colander or On heated 
pieces of brown paper. They are then placed in a hot dish, feind sprinkled over with powdered 
white sugar, and eaten hot with Café au Lait.
         </p>
         <p>
The above quantity will make six cakes. Increase in proportion.

Calas may also be made of 
<ingredient xmlns="http://luc.edu/ctsdh/ns/1.0" class="grain">rice flour</ingredient>.
In olden days the Cala women used to pound the rice themselves in a mortar till they reduced it 
to a fine powder or flour. Then it was mixed and set to rise overnight. If the rice flour is used,
one tablespoonful of wheat flour is sufficient to bind. Often in 
<name>large Creole families</name>, where 
rice is left over from the day before, the quantity is increased by adding a cup of well-sifted 
self-raising flour. But these cakes, though very nice and palatable, are not the true "Calas," 
which are made entirely of rice, with only a little flour to bind, as directed above.

pour the batter from the pitcher and fill the iron quickly. Then close quickly and set on the fire
. As soon as the edges are set, turn the iron and bake on the other side. Two minutes should be 
all the time required to bake a waffle nicely. The waffle must be baked evenly. Always select the
simple waffle baker with four compartments in preference to the more elaborate designs. Better 
results will be achieved. When the waffles are baked, remove them carefully, place on a hot dish,
piling them in double rows, and butter them generously. Rice waffles are generally served with

set to brown nicely in a quick oven for about twenty-five minutes. When well browned, have ready
a meringue, which you will have made by beating the whites of two eggs to a froth (reserve the 
whites of two eggs), and add to this two tablespoonfuls of powdered white sugar. Spread all this
over the pudding. Let it brown slightly in a hot oven, or the meringue will fall. Serve either 
hot or very cold. The pudding may be made without the addition of the pineapple.

Wash the rice clean, and boll according to recipe in about a pint and a quarter of water. In 
half an hour take off and drain of all water, and press through a sieve. Then add it to the milk,
and let it boil slowly a half hour longer without burning. Whip the cream to a stiff froth, and 
add the drain to the rice or milk, and set the whipped cream to cool until it is needed. Beat 
the yolks of the eggs and the sugar until they are very light. Add them to the boiling rice, 
stirring constantly and well, and let it cook for two min-

utes, adding in the meantime the grated peel of the orange. Take the mixture from the fire. Then
add the tablespoonful of vanilla, and the grated nutmeg. Mix well and set out to cool. Remove 
the dasher from the ice cream freezer, and when the mixture has become very cool, turn It into 
the freezer and let it set packed in rock salt and ice for three hours.

   <p>
In the meantime take a dozen sweet Louisiana oranges, and peel and cut them crosswise into 
halves. Take out the cores with the share point of a penknife, and set them in a dish ready for 
use. Put a round of sugar to boil with one gill of water, and after ten minutes add the 
<ingredient xmlns="http://luc.edu/ctsdh/ns/1.0" class="fruit juice">juice of half a lemon</ingredient>
. Put a few pieces at a time of the oranges into this boiling liquid, and lay them out side by 
side in a flat dish. Pour over them the syrup that remains from the boiling, and set the dish 
in the ice box to cool. When ready to serve, wipe thoroughly the outside of the can that contains
the pudding, and all around the edges, so as to remove any traces of salt. Wet a towel in 
boiling water and stand the can upon it. Open the can. Put a round dish on top, and then turn 
quickly upside down, and remove the can. If the pudding adheres, repeat the applcations of the 
hot towel at the bottom and around. Place the oranges on top and all around the pudding, and 
pour over them the syrup, which has become cool, but not frozen. Serve immediately. This is one
of the most delicious, as well as one of the most typical of our Louisiana methods of serving 
rice as a dessert.

Enough has been said and written In these recipes to give an idea of the possibilities of 
Louisiana rice under proper methods of culinary preparation. It enters into many different 
combinations in cooking, and among the poorer Creoles of large families it takes, in a great 
measure, the place of bread. A meal of boiled rice, with

may be parched in the same manner as popcorn. It is a method of cooking rice that came to 
New Orleans from the West Indies, and was brought into general use by the San Domingo refugees, 
who came to New Orleans in numbers after the great insurrection. When the culture of rice became
general in the southwestern parishes of our State, these old settlers began to give 
rice-parching parties, and they became very fashionable. The <name>Creole children</name>
and the belles and beaux of eighty years ago enjoyed parching rice just as much as northern 
children, youths and maidens enjoy roasting chestnuts or parching corn. Rice Is parched in the 
same manner as the <name>Creoles</name> parch popcorn. The parched grain of rice becomes a
