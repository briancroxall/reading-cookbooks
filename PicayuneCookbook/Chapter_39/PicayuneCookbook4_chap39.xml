                    <p>Perhaps no cuisine can boast of such a number of delicious small cakes that may serve for desserts, both elegant and choice, as
                        the Creole cuisine. The native ingenuity of the Creole chefs adapted many of the nuts and fruits of Louisiana to various forms
                        of sweetened batter, and the result of their efforts, handed down from generation to generation, is given in the following
                        carefully compiled recipes, which, perhaps, after our unique “Gumbos,” “Courtbouillons,” “Bouillabaise,” “Ragouts” and
                        “Jambalayas,” will serve better than any other recipes to give a true idea of the infinite variety and delight of the properly
                        conducted Creole kitchen. They will also give a glimpse into the interior life of the Creole household,
                        <!-- column 2 begins--> some of them, especially, being associated with pleasant, simple forms of “soirées,” that, alas! have
                        almost passed away since the intercourse of the old French quarter with the American city above Canal Street has become so
                        general.</p>

                    <head rend="align(center) bold">Advice and Instructions for Baking These Cakes</head>

                    <p>Use the best materials. It always pays in the delicate and perfect taste of the cake.</p>
                    <p>Soda, if not properly dissolved, will give to cakes and biscuits a bad, greenish color.</p>
                    <p>Keep the cake out of the draft while beating and baking. All the following cakes, as, indeed, all cakes, should be baked in
                        their own steam, that is, keep the door and damper shut till the cakes have finished spreading. Then, if the oven is hot
                        enough, you may open the damper. This gives the cake a light, bright<pb n="289"/><!-- column 1 begins--> color. Remember
                        meringues and other large cakes are not intended in these instructions. For meringues the oven must never be very hot.</p>
                    <p>If you are expert at baking, you may test the heat of the oven simply by touching the handle of the oven door, but a sure test
                        for beginners is to throw a little cornmeal or flour in the center of the oven, count ten, and if the flour begins to smoke
                        before you count the full number the oven is too hot, if it smokes at ten the oven has the proper heat.</p>
                    <p>Never put flavoring extracts directly into the flour, or they will form lumps. Always put them in the wet part of the
                        mixture.</p>

                    <div type="orentationNote">In order to make meringues properly one should have a meringue board of well-seasoned hard wood. This
                        board should be cut with rounded corners, and of a size convenient to the oven. It ought to be about one and a half inches in
                        thickness. While baking, Meringues must always remain soft underneath. To accomplish then, dampen the board thoroughly with
                        water before plac-<pb n="297"/><!--Column 1 begins-->ing the bands of paper upon it. In this way the Meringues are prevented
                        from receiving heat in sufficient volume to render them hard underneath.</div>

                        <div type="instructions">Beat the whites to a stiff, snowy froth, and then gradually add the sugar and vanilla, eating until
                            the mixture is stiff enough to cut with a knife. Then cut some stout sheets of foolscap paper into strips measuring at
                            least two inches in width, or, if you wish to make the meringues larger, simply place the sheet of paper, slightly
                            buttered, on the table. Take a tablespoon and gather up the meringue mixture as nearly as possible in the shape of an egg,
                            and working it towards the side of the bowl to give it this shape, and then drop sloping from the spoon upon the strips of
                            paper at a distance of at least an inch apart. Draw the edge of the spoon very sharply around the edge of the meringue, to
                            give it a smooth, round shape, resembling an egg. When all the rows are filled, sprinkle sifted sugar over them, and let
                            them remain in this state for about three minutes. Then take hold of the strips at either end, and shake lightly, to
                            remove all excess sugar. Place the strips in rows about one inch apart on the wet board or baking tin (the board is much
                            better), and as soon as the sugar begins to dissolve slightly onto their surface, push them into the oven, which must be
                            at a very moderate heat, and bake them a very light fawn color. Watch constantly, that they may not burn. When the
                            meringues are done, remove each one very carefully and separately from the paper. Then use a small dessert spoon, if you
                            desire to fill the meringues, scoop out the soft white part, and, with the outer side of the bowl of the spoon, smooth the
                            interior of the meringues. Then place them with the rounded side downward on the baking tin in the oven to dry for a few
                            minutes. When thoroughly crip, without browning, place them between sheets of paper in a dry place. When using meringues
                            for desserts, etc., garnish the interior with whipped cream, beaten to a stiff froth, and flavored with vanilla, orange,
                            lemon, orange flower water, or any kind of fancy liqueur, stick the two halves together lightly and serve. Meringues may
                            be kept for some time in thir dry shell state, and filled when ready to use. In making them for immediate family use,
                            <!--column 2 begins--> simply drop the mixture by spoonfuls on buttered paper, dust with the sugar, wait for three
                            minutes, fan or blow off all excess sugar, and then place them in a very moderate oven and bake to a light brown. When
                            dry, carefully remove the meringue from the paper, after they have cooled, brush the bottoms slightly with the white of an
                            egg, beaten to a froth, stick two meringues together, put away to dry, and serve as needed.</div>
