               <p>The <name>Creoles</name> pride themselves upon their famous "<foreign xml:lang="fr">Soupe à la Tortue</foreign>," and justly;
                  the old saying that only a good Creole cook knows how to make a good Turtle Soup being testified to by epicurean visitors from
                  every country.</p>
               <p>The following is one of the simplest and best ways of making Turtle Soup—a recipe that may always be relied upon and one that
                  has been used from generation to generation in the most aristocratic Creole homes:</p>
               <p>In making Turtle Soup, remember that Green Turtle is always the best for this purpose. Select two pounds of fine Green Turtle
                  meat, if the turtle is not bought whole. This amount will make soup for six persons. Increase proportionately. If <pb n="20"
                  />the turtle is bought whole, first cut off the head. To do this properly, the turtle should be hung with the head downwards,
                  and a very sharp knife should be used to cut off the head as close as possible. Often for hours after this operation is
                  performed, the turtle will exhibit extraordinary signs of life, the flesh quivering constantly. The <name>old Creole
                     cooks</name> say that a turtle never dies, but this is a darky tradition. To remove the shells, first separate the upper
                  from the lower shell, always being exceedingly careful to avoid touching the gall bladder, which is very large. If this
                  bladder is penetrated, the contents running over the turtle meat would render it utterly unfit for use.</p>
               <p>Clean the turtle and the entrails by cutting open and washing thoroughly in cold water. Then put the meat and entrails into a
                  saucepan and parboil about ten minutes. Be careful to save this stock of water. Chop an onion very fine, and the ham into very
                  fine pieces. Cut the turtle meat into one-inch pieces, mash the cloves and the allspice very fine and chop the thyme and bay
                  leaf. Brown the onions in a tablespoonful of butter or lard, and add immediately the turtle meat. Brown together slightly and
                  after minutes add the chopped ham. Let this continue browning and then add two cloves of garlic, chopped fine, and the thyme,
                  bay leaf (minced fine), cloves and allspice (ground), all mixed together, and lay on the turtle. Stir this almost constantly
                  to prevent curing, and add two tablespoonfuls of flour that has been well rubbed, stirring constantly all the time. Then
                  dissolve the meat with the water in which the turtle was parboiled, adding gradually until a certain consistency is reached.
                  About three quarts of water will be the required amount. Season this with salt, black pepper and Cayenne to taste, and boil
                  slowly for fully an hour, stirring almost constantly. After cooking on hour taste, and if not seasoned sufficiently, season
                  again and taste. Then chop one-quarter of a small lemon and put it in the soup. Let it continue to cook, and when well
                  done—that is, when no blood exudes from the turtle after sticking it with a fork—pour into the tureen. Add the whites and
                  yolks of two hard-boiled eggs, chopped fine, and one good glass of Sherry wine. This is a dish fit for a king and is most
                  highly recommended as a genuine Creole Turtle Soup.</p>

               <p>Clean the turtle and entrails by cutting open the latter and washing thoroughly in cold water. Then put the meat and entrails into a saucepan 
                  and parboil them for ten minutes. Carefully save this stock of water. Chop the onion very fine, and cut the ham into very fine pieces. 
                  Cut the turtle meat into one-inch pieces; mash the allspice very fine, and mince the parsley, thyme and bay leaf. 
                  Then brown the onions in the lard and butter mixed, and almost immediately add the turtle meat. Brown together for ten 
                  minutes and add the finely chopped ham. As this continues to brown, add the cloves of garlic (minced fine), the thyme and bay 
                  leaf and the ground allspice. Mix all together, stirring almost constantly to prevent burning. Then add the well-rubbed 
                  tablespoonfuls of flour, stirring constantly. Scald and skin the tomatoes and chop them fine, and add to the turtle meat. 
                  When well-browned, pour over three quarts of the water in which the turtle was parboiled, season with salt and pepper and Cayenne to taste, 
                  and let it boil slowly for fully an hour, stirring frequently. After one hour, taste the soup, and, if not sufficiently seasoned, 
                  add seasoning of salt, pepper and Cayenne again, according to taste. Let it cook for an hour longer and then take off 
                  the stove if the turtle is thoroughly done. This may be ascertained by sticking it with a fork. 
                  If no blood exudes, the soup is ready to serve. Take off the stove and strain through a colander into the tureen. 
                  Add the whites and yolks of two hard-boiled eggs, chopped fine, and one good glass of Sherry or White Wine. 
                  Slice a lemon fine and add to the soup and serve hot.

                  <p>
                     Great care should be taken in serving the soup. It should be borne in mind that boiling 
                     the soup a second time, or warming it over, deprives it of much of its delicious flavor. 
                     To avoid this, fill two tureens with boil-
                  <pb n="21"/>
                     ing water; let them stand a few minutes, then dry the inside thoroughly and place the tureens in a "bain-marie," of a hot-water bath. 
                     Fill the tureens with the soup and cover tightly. Bring them to the table as needed, throwing in just before serving, some dainty
                     slices of lemon. If the meat is served, use only the most delicate portions.
