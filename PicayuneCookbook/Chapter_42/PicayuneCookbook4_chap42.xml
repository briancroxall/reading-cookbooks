                <head>FRUIT SYRUPS, CORDIALS, ETC.</head>
                <head>Des Sirops, des Liqueurs, Etc.</head>
                <div type="prefatory"><p>No book on Creole cookery would be complete without reference to those delightful fruit syrups which, under the names of "Sirops," "Ratafias," "Granits," etc., enter so largely into the home and social life of the Creoles. Again, the ancient Creole housekeepers are famous for the delicious "Cordials" or "Liqueurs" that they put up each year. Anisette as grateful to the palate as that manufactured by the famous French distilleries is made at home by the Creoles, as also various kinds of domestic wines, than which a better quality could not be purchased from professional manufacturers.</p>
                    <p>Before entering into a discussion of these "Sirops" and "Liqueurs," the Picayune will refer to the ancient custom the Creoles have of serving sweetened water after a hearty meal, and which, under the name of
                        <hi>EAU SUCRÉE,</hi>
                        has been handed down from generation to generation as an integral part of the life of the Creole household.</p>
                    <p>To one glass of fresh water allow one tablespoonful of sugar, or to a half glass allow a half tablespoonful stir till the sugar is dissolved, and drink after a hearty meal. Every old Creole clings to his glass of "Eau Sucré." He claims that this custom accounts for the singular freedom that the Creoles, as a rule, enjoy from that distressing complaint, becoming so common in America — Dyspepsia. It is the rarest thing in the world to hear a Creole complain of any stomachic trouble, notwithstanding heavy dinners, numbers of courses, and richest viands and wines. The Eau Sucrée is passed around the table at the close of the meal, and the children, as well as their elders, enjoy the drink.
                        Again "Eau Sucré" is used by all Creole mothers as a sedative for their little ones. Just before kissing her babes "Good-night," the Creole mother will give them a small glass of "Eau Sucrée." It is claimed that it insures digestion and perfect sleep.</p>
                    <p>"Eau Sucré" parties were famous in old New Orleans in those happy, innocent days when friend met friend in social gatherings for the pleasure of social intercourse, and <!-- end column one --><!-- start column two --> not for the sake of the grand spread of fancy viands and wines that have become such a source of terror in our day to the housewife of limited means who wishes to entertain her friends. "With that beautiful old-time courtesy so peculiar to the Creoles, the poor young woman who entertained was placed on an equal with her richer sister, for it became a kind if unwritten law that beyond a glass of lemonade and cake, or a glass of "Eau Sucrée," nothing more was expected of the household. There was no tax. no drain; the faubourg laughed and sang and danced, night after night, on Iced "Eau Sucrée," or Iced Lemonade, and Orgeats, and Ice Creams, with as much zest as when grand suppers were spread and champagne flowed. There were no heartaches, no pangs, no sad thoughts, because Madame So-and-So, who lived in the Rue Esplanade or Rue Rampart, had given a grander ball than her poorer sister, who lived in the Rue de Bons Enfants or the Rue d'Amour. All this has passed away with the changing life of the old French quarter. But "Eau Sucrée" remains, and the Picayune refers to it upon the merits claimed by the Creoles, that it promotes easy digestion and insures freedom from insomnia. These claims are borne out by the longevity and good spirits for which the race is famous.</p></div>
                
                <div><head>SYRUPS.</head>
                    <head>Sirops.</head>
                    Under this heading are classed those delightful beverages of fruits or nuts, served by the Creole housewives during the summer season. Of a hot, sultry day, if you enter a well-regulated Creole household, the first thing Madame will do will be to regale you with a glass of Lemonade, or "Iced Orgeat," or "Iced Pineapple," etc. The syrups are put up and bottled by Madame herself, and are al- ways at hand. Old "Tante Zizi," in bandana and tignon, knows the customs of the household well, and does not need to be told by Madame to prepare a nice, cooling glass of "Sirop" for her guest. In a few moments you will see her enter the parlor or sitting room with a dainty <!-- end column two --><!-- end page 312 --><!-- start page 313 --><!-- start column one -->silver salver, covered with a snowy napkin, and bearing, according to the number of visitors, the glasses of iced "Sirop." Of an evening, as the family sit out on the "Esplanade" or the gallery to enjoy the freshening breezes, she will come again unbidden to bring her "people" the daily refreshing summer drink. It is all these pretty little customs and touches that make life in a Creole household so pleasant and full of variety.
                    
                    <head>General Directions for Making Syrups.</head>
                    The Plain Syrup, that is the basis of all fruit syrups, is simply sugar and water boiled together in the pro- portion of two pounds of sugar to a pint and a half of water. Cook the sugar and water till it forms the syrup called "Le Petit Casse" (see recipe under heading "Sugar as Employed in Candy-Making"), or crack, that is, cook it till it instantly snaps asunder when placed between the fingers after dipping them in cold water to enable one to test. Then add the Fruit Syrup, and mix thoroughly. Let it boil for about five minutes; take off the fire and let it get almost cold, then bottle very tight. This is the invariable rule to be followed in making syrups of fruits.
                    One quart of fruit when mashed and pressed will make a pint of Fruit Syrup, to be added to the Plain Syrup given above.</div>

Then strain through a bag, pressing out all the juice. Cook the sugar and water till it forms the syrup called "Le Petit Casse.' (See general directions for Making Syrups). Then add the apricot juice and mix thoroughly; let it boil for five minutes, take off the fire, let it get almost cold, add the essence, and then bottle for use.

                <div> Orgeat Syrup.
                    Sirop d'Orgeat.
                    1 Pound of Sweet Almonds.
                    4 Ounces of Bitter Almonds.
                    2 Pounds of Sugar.
                    1 Quart of Water.
                    2 Ounces of Orange Flower Water.
                    The Zest of a Lemon.
                    Do not throw the almonds into hot water and' blanch them, as in other recipes for almonds, but throw them into cold water, after shelling them, until the peeling or skin comes off easily. Then mash them and pound them in a mortar till they are reduced to a fine powder, adding, from time to time, a little water and the well-grated zest of the lemon, When this paste is perfectly made, moisten it with one-half of the water, and then squeeze it hard through a linen cloth, each end of which is held by some one, when you will have drained thoroughly of all milk. Then return the paste to the mortar, throw over the rest of the water, mix thoroughly, pounding well, and then squeeze again through the towel. Put the sugar into a farina boiler, and let it boil to the degree of "Le Petit Cassé," or crack,' that is, till it forms a thick syrup that will not cling to the teeth in tasting, or instantly snaps asunder between the fingers after testing in cold water. Then take the syrup off the fire and add the milk of almonds, stirring well. Return it to the fire, and let it simmer gently till it begins to boil. Let it boil for several minutes. Then take it off the fire and let it cool. When cold, add the orange flower water and mix well. Then drain all through a cloth or bag, and fill and seal the bottles.
                    Orgeat, being made of the milk of almonds, easily decomposes or sours, because the oil of almonds, being lighter than the other ingredients, rises to the top. For this reason, it is well to look at the bottles frequently, and shake them daily. This will preserve the exact mingling of the mixture, and also preserve the Orgeat for use.
                    Orgeat is a great Creole syrup. It is not only a most delicate drink, but a healthy, popular and traditional one. In old Creole households upon the birth of a babe, the friends who call to congratulate the parents upon the new addition to the household are served with a glass of Orgeat, the mother drinking with her friends in honor of the little angel just sent from heaven. This is an ancient Creole custom, dating from earliest days in Louisiana.
                    Use only the finest white loaf sugar in making Orgeat Syrup.</div>
