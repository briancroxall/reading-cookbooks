                    <p>The <name>Creoles</name> pride themselves upon their famous "<foreign xml:lang="fr">Soupe à la Tortue</foreign>," and justly;
                        the old saying that only a good Creole cook knows how to make a good Turtle Soup being testified to by epicurean visitors from
                        every country.</p>
                    <p>The following is one of the simplest and best ways of making Turtle Soup—a recipe that may always be relied upon and one that
                        has been used from generation to generation in the most aristocratic Creole homes:</p>
                    <p>In making Turtle Soup, remember that Green Turtle is always the best for this purpose. Select two pounds of fine Green Turtle
                        meat, if the turtle is not bought whole. This amount will make soup for six persons. Increase proportionately. If <pb n="20"
                        />the turtle is bought whole, first cut off the head. To do this properly, the turtle should be hung with the head downwards,
                        and a very sharp knife should be used to cut off the head as close as possible. Often for hours after this operation is
                        performed, the turtle will exhibit extraordinary signs of life, the flesh quivering constantly. The old <name>Creole</name>
                            cooks say that a turtle never dies, but this is a darky tradition. To remove the shells, first separate the upper
                        from the lower shell, always being exceedingly careful to avoid touching the gall bladder, which is very large. If this
                        bladder is penetrated, the contents running over the turtle meat would render it utterly unfit for use.</p>
                    <p>Clean the turtle and the entrails by cutting open and washing thoroughly in cold water. Then put the meat and entrails into a
                        saucepan and parboil about ten minutes. Be careful to save this stock of water. Chop an onion very fine, and the ham into very
                        fine pieces. Cut the turtle meat into one-inch pieces, mash the cloves and the allspice very fine and chop the thyme and bay
                        leaf. Brown the onions in a tablespoonful of butter or lard, and add immediately the turtle meat. Brown together slightly and
                        after minutes add the chopped ham. Let this continue browning and then add two cloves of garlic, chopped fine, and the thyme,
                        bay leaf (minced fine), cloves and allspice (ground), all mixed together, and lay on the turtle. Stir this almost constantly
                        to prevent curing, and add two tablespoonfuls of flour that has been well rubbed, stirring constantly all the time. Then
                        dissolve the meat with the water in which the turtle was parboiled, adding gradually until a certain consistency is reached.
                        About three quarts of water will be the required amount. Season this with salt, black pepper and Cayenne to taste, and boil
                        slowly for fully an hour, stirring almost constantly. After cooking on hour taste, and if not seasoned sufficiently, season
                        again and taste. Then chop one-quarter of a small lemon and put it in the soup. Let it continue to cook, and when well
                        done—that is, when no blood exudes from the turtle after sticking it with a fork—pour into the tureen. Add the whites and
                        yolks of two hard-boiled eggs, chopped fine, and one good glass of Sherry wine. This is a dish fit for a king and is most
                        highly recommended as a genuine Creole Turtle Soup.</p>
